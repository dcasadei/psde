  Quick start: call the example script from your command line:

  [prompt]$ root -q -b plotSign.C+

  This will produce the last figure in the paper, showing the
  comparison between data and expectation with an inset plotting the
  bin significance computed from the number of observed events and the
  expected number of events, with and without uncertainty on the
  expectation.

  The math is implemented in pValuePoissonError.C while the ROOT
  graphics is implemented in CompareHistograms.C (both included by
  plotSign.C).  The script plotSign.C is just an example which shows
  how to use these two macros.  In CmpDataMC.C a more elaborate
  example is provided, which also plots a stacked sum of histograms
  representing all contributions to the total expectation.

  The repository can be accessed using (ssh is faster)

     svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/guest/psde
     svn co https://svn.cern.ch/guest/psde 

  (co makes a Check Out of the project and creates the psde local
  directory with the code).  Developers can access the repository with
  the substitution guest -> reps.
